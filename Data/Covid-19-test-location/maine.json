    "description": "With only a few walk-in clinics nearby, Dexter Family Health & Urgent Care may be your best option for immediate care in Dexter. They are open today from 8:00AM to 6:00PM, as well as 5 days a week. As long as you visit them during their business hours, you should be able to walk right into 51 High St and be seen relatively quickly. The national average for patients waiting at an urgent care is between 15-30 minutes, so hopefully it shouldn't be too long of a wait.",
